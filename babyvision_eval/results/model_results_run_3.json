    "ModelResult": "Based on a careful visual inspection of the grid, let's look for differences in the silhouettes.\n\nThe grid is 7 rows by 7 columns. I will scan through them:\n\n*   **Rows 1-4:** All the silhouettes appear identical. They all face right, have a tail curling up slightly, and four legs visible.\n*   **Row 5:** Let's look closely at the 4th silhouette in the 5th row.\n    *   Compare the silhouette at position (5,4) with its neighbors like (5,3) or (5,5).\n    *   Look at the front legs. The \"standard\" silhouette has two front legs clearly visible with a gap between them.\n    *   However, the silhouette at **row 5, column 4** is missing the back-most front leg; it only shows one front leg, or rather, the gap between the front legs is missing, making it look like a single thick leg or that one is hidden. Wait, let me look closer.\n    *   Actually, a more distinct difference is often found in the tail or legs. Let's re-examine.\n    *   Upon closer inspection of the entire grid, all the tigers are identical *except* for the one in the **6th row, 3rd column**.\n    *   Let's check position (6,3). Compare its legs to the others. In the standard silhouette, there is a clear separation between the two hind legs and the two front legs.\n    *   Now let's look at the **5th row, 4th column** again. The difference is subtle.\n    *   Let me look for a different type of anomaly. Is one flipped? No. Is a tail missing? No.\n    *   Let's look at the **legs**.\n        *   Standard tiger: The back legs show one leg slightly \"behind\" the other. The front legs show one leg slightly \"behind\" the other.\n        *   Let's sweep again.\n        *   Row 1: All same.\n        *   Row 2: All same.\n        *   Row 3: All same.\n        *   Row 4: All same.\n        *   Row 5: The tiger at **(5, 4)** (Row 5, Column 4) is different. Look at its **front legs**. In all other tigers, you can see two distinct front paws/legs. In the tiger at (5,4), the front legs are merged or one is missing, such that there is no gap/distinction between the left and right front leg at the bottom. The other silhouettes have a distinct little cutout or line separating the two front feet. This one does not.\n\n    *   Wait, let me double-check. Let's look at **Row 6, Column 2**? No.\n    *   Let's look at **Row 5, Column 3** vs **Row 5, Column 4**.\n        *   (5,3): Two front legs visible.\n        *   (5,4): The front leg area looks slightly different. Actually, looking even closer at the original image, in the silhouette at (5,4), the **back** foot appearing behind the front-most back leg is missing.\n        *   Let's be precise. Most tigers have 4 visible 'feet' bottoms.\n            *   1 back-left foot.\n            *   1 back-right foot (slightly forward).\n            *   1 front-left foot.\n            *   1 front-right foot (slightly forward).\n        *   Look at tiger **(5,4)**. It has only three visible feet touching the ground line. The rear-most front leg is missing (or the front-most back leg... it's hard to tell without zoom). Let's compare (5,4) to (5,5).\n        *   (5,5) has four distinct leg stumps.\n        *   (5,4) has four distinct leg stumps. Wait.\n    *   Let's try again. Look at the **ears**.\n    *   Look at the **tails**.\n    *   Let me scan for a \"missing leg\" anomaly again, which is very common in these puzzles.\n    *   **Row 6, Column 5?** No.\n    *   Let's look at **Row 5, Column 4** again. Ah, I see it clearly now. Look at the **front legs**. In every other tiger, the front legs are composed of two shapes. In the tiger at (5,4), **the inner front leg is missing**. There is just one front leg visible.\n\n    Let me verify this against others.\n    *   (5,3): Has two front legs.\n    *   (5,5): Has two front legs.\n    *   **(5,4)**: Has only **one** front leg.\n\nTherefore, the odd one out is in the 5th row and 4th column.\n\n\\boxed{(5,4)}",

    "ModelResult": "The image displays a grid of \"index pointing up\" hand emojis. The repeated pattern consists of groups of three hands: a light-skinned hand, a dark-skinned hand, and another light-skinned hand.\n\nLet's examine the grid row by row to spot any deviation from this pattern.\n\n1.  **Row 1:** The pattern is consistent (Light, Dark, Light) across all groups.\n2.  **Row 2:** Consistent.\n3.  **Row 3:** Consistent.\n4.  **Row 4:** Consistent.\n5.  **Row 5:** Consistent.\n6.  **Row 6:** Consistent.\n7.  **Row 7:** Consistent.\n8.  **Row 8:** Consistent.\n9.  **Row 9:** Consistent.\n10. **Row 10:** Consistent.\n11. **Row 11:** Looking closely at the group in the 9th column (counting each group of 3 hands as one column unit for easier visual scanning, or checking the single hand columns). Let's count individual hand columns. The 25th, 26th, and 27th hands make a group. Wait, let me count the \"groups\". There are 10 groups of 3 hands in each row.\n    *   Row 11, Group 9 (hands 25, 26, 27): The hands are Light, Dark, Dark. The third hand in this triplet is dark brown instead of the usual yellow/light skin tone.\n    *   Let's verify the coordinates based on the question's likely interpretation. The question asks for the \"row and column\". Since the pattern is a repeated motif, the \"column\" usually refers to the specific instance of that motif.\n    *   Let's re-examine the grid structure. There are 16 rows of emojis. There are 30 columns of individual emojis. However, the visual \"pattern\" is clearly groups of 3. But usually, in these puzzles, \"column\" refers to the horizontal position of the odd-one-out item itself.\n    *   Let's pinpoint the exact odd emoji.\n    *   Row 11 (counting from top).\n    *   Column: The anomaly is the 27th emoji from the left. Let's look at the group again. The group is the 9th group from the left. The hands in the 9th group are at columns 25, 26, 27. The sequence is Light-Dark-Dark. The standard sequence is Light-Dark-Light. Therefore, the 27th emoji is the one that is different (it's dark instead of light).\n    *   However, often these \"find the odd one out\" puzzles are organized into a simpler grid of \"cells\". Let's count the number of repeated \"triplet\" blocks.\n        *   Horizontal blocks: 10\n        *   Vertical blocks: 16\n    *   Let's look at the location again. It's in the 11th row from the top. It is in the 9th block from the left.\n    *   The question asks for row `a` and column `b`. Often `b` refers to the column index of the *item* if they are treated as individual grid cells. Let's assume the question treats each triplet as a single \"pattern unit\" since the question asks \"In which row and column... is the pattern different\".\n    *   So, Row = 11. Column = 9.\n    *   Let's double check row 11.\n        *   Row 10: ... \u261d\ufe0f\ud83c\udfff\u261d\ufe0f ...\n        *   Row 11: ... \u261d\ufe0f\ud83c\udfff\u261d\ud83c\udfff ... (The third hand in the 9th triplet is dark). Yes.\n        *   Row 12: ... \u261d\ufe0f\ud83c\udfff\u261d\ufe0f ...\n    *   So the anomaly is at Row 11, in the 9th repetition of the pattern.\n\n    Let's re-read to ensure the definition of \"column\". If the grid is 16 rows by 10 columns of *groups*, the answer is (11, 9). If the grid is 16 rows by 30 columns of *hands*, the answer might be specific to the hand index. But \"the pattern different\" implies the pattern unit. The pattern unit is the triplet. The 9th triplet in the 11th row is different.\n\n    Let's verify the coordinates one more time.\n    *   Count down rows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, **11**.\n    *   Count across pattern groups (triplets): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, **9**. The 9th group looks like (Light hand, Dark hand, Dark hand). All others are (Light hand, Dark hand, Light hand).\n\n    Therefore, the row is 11 and the column is 9.\n\n\\boxed{(11, 9)}",
