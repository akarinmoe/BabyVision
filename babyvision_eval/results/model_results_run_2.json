Initially, the dominant silhouette appears to be a lioness. Now I need to consider what, if anything, deviates from this norm. My focus is on determining what differentiates any single element from the rest.\n\n\n**Assessing Row Anomalies**\n\nI'm now methodically assessing each row for deviations. So far, the lioness/tiger silhouettes appear uniform across most of the grid, but I will be investigating each of the 7 rows. I'm noting specific details like the angle of the head and tail, and the leg positions, which appear to be the primary points of potential variation.\n\n\n"

Almost every group follows the same sequence: a yellow hand pointing up, a brown (darker skin tone) hand pointing up, and another yellow hand pointing up. So, the standard pattern is **Yellow-Brown-Yellow**.\n\n2.  **Scan Each Row:** I will look through the rows from top to bottom, checking each triplet (column) from left to right.\n\n    *   **Rows 1-9:** All triplets appear to follow the Yellow-Brown-Yellow pattern.\n    *   **Row 10:** Moving across the row...\n        *   Column 1: Yellow-Brown-Yellow\n        *   Column 2: Yellow-Brown-Yellow\n        *   ...\n        *   Column 8: Yellow-Brown-Yellow\n        *   **Column 9:** Looking closely at the 9th group in the 10th row, the pattern is **Yellow-Brown-Brown**.
